## Project Description

This website application displays up-coming event information on a public info screen. 
Example usage: Display events/classes near a classroom entrance.

The website is optimized for 1080 pixel (width), and 1920 pixel (height) respectfully. It will scale down to lower resolutions (720 pixel width for example) if necessary, without cutting content.

Event items contain time, date, title and description properties. They can be added, removed and edited by the user via a google spread sheet. If the website is not refreshed manually, it will update automatically every 30 minutes.  

## Future features to implement

- Automatic removal of expired events.
- Sort events automatically by date.
- Conditional styling of events, e.g. change entry-background-color for same-day events.
