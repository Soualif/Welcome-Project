#Retrospective

## Achievements
- Designed a simple website from scratch with raw HTML and CSS.
- Copied mockup design almost 1:1, incl. leading zeros in date subtitle.
- Optimization for given screen size but will adjust to smaller width screens without cutting content.
- content dynamically filled.


## Areas of improvement
- Would have liked to add more features. Did not calculate enough time to conceptualize the programming of extra features. I.o.W. I either generously reserve time for extra features, or I let it be.  Half-done programs are a waist of time.  

## Issues
- spent too much time on design issues (trying to implement bootstrap with vue-cli). Started from scratch without bootstrap.

## What I learned
- To precisely copy the design of a mockup in HTML and CSS only, without relying on bootstrap. Used the css-flexbox instead. Gained more confidence in raw CSS.
- How to access data using axios. 
- How to dynamically fill a site with content via a google spreadsheet.
- Better understanding of the purpose, use and structure of certain API's.
- A basic understanding of vue and how to deepen those skills in the future.
